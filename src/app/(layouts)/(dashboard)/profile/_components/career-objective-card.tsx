          My career spans more than 13 years during which I have honed my skills
          popular modern frameworks and libraries such as Next JS, Nuxt JS,
          React, Vue, Node JS, Express JS Laravel, and animation techs. I have a
          proven track record of creating high-performance web applications that
          deliver dynamic and an exceptional user experience. Additionally, I am
          proficient in collaborating with cross-functional teams, including
